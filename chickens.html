Chicken
The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red junglefowl species that are originally from
Southeast Asia.
They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowls (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and
green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A
male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called
a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.
Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for
meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.
